# Epinova.Associations

Flexible, easy to use two way relationship between content nodes.

- Supports ContentReference, `IList<ContentReference>` and ContentArea as both source and target for an association, and you can use differerent types in each end of the relationship.
- Matches association sources and targets on **property name** (meaning you can have multiple different associations per content type)
- To use, let your content type class implement IAssociationContent, and simply add `[ContentAssociation]` to the properties you want to use for associations.
    - Supports `IContent`, meaning association properties can be added to both pages, blocks or media types; anything  that implements `IReadOnly` and `IContent`.
    - To limit what content types go where, use `[AllowedTypes]`; this can vary on each end of the relationships
- Associations are saved to the [otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn_YodiJO6k) of the relationship on publishing

## Examples

    [ContentType(GUID = "...")]
    public class EmployeePage : BasePageData, IAssociationContent
    {
        [ContentAssociation]
        public virtual ContentArea EmployeeDocuments { get; set; }
		
        [ContentAssociation]
        public virtual ContentArea Author { get; set; }
    }

    [ContentType(GUID = "...")]
    public class DocumentPage : BasePageData, IAssociationContent
    {
        [ContentAssociation]
        public virtual IList<ContentReference> EmployeeDocuments { get; set; }
				
        [ContentAssociation]
        public virtual ContentReference Author { get; set; }
    }

Here, whatever you add into the `EmployeeDocuments` will be reflected to the other side of the relationship when you publish your content. Note that the property has the same *name* on both content types.

You can even use `[AllowedTypes]` in combination with this to restrict what types go where, like so:

    [ContentType(GUID = "...")]
    public class EmployeePage : BasePageData, IAssociationContent
    {
        [ContentAssociation]
        [AllowedTypes(typeof(DocumentPage))]
        public virtual ContentArea EmployeeDocuments { get; set; }
		
        [ContentAssociation]
        [AllowedTypes(typeof(DocumentPage))]
        public virtual ContentArea Author { get; set; }
    }

    [ContentType(GUID = "...")]        
    public class DocumentPage : BasePageData, IAssociationContent
    {
        [ContentAssociation]
        [AllowedTypes(typeof(EmployeePage))]
        public virtual IList<ContentReference> EmployeeDocuments { get; set; }
		
        [ContentAssociation]
        [AllowedTypes(typeof(EmployeePage))]
        public virtual ContentReference Author { get; set; }
    }
